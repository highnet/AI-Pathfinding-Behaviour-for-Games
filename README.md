# AI Pathfinding Behaviour for Games

A C# project implementing advanced AI pathfinding algorithms and behaviours for use in game development. This project demonstrates graph-based navigation, node and connection management, and customizable pathfinding strategies suitable for a variety of game genres.

## Core Technologies

- C# (.NET)
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Graph Theory
- Pathfinding Algorithms (e.g., A\*, Dijkstra)

## Getting Started
